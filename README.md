# Google-Homepage

This is one of the first pages I built when learning HTML and CSS. The goal was to rebuild the Google homepage as closely as possible. It was done using only HTML and CSS. I used this project as a way to cement my HTML and CSS skills and find the gaps in my knowledge. I also used it as a possible project to put on the early versions of my portfolio.
